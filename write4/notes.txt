like the previous challenges, the buffer is 0x20 bytes long with a large overflow
according to ROPgadget, a chain can be created to put the string 'flag.txt'
in the .data section
this is done by using the mov [r14], r15 ; ret gadget
where r14 is the destination of the string and r15 is 8 bytes of the string
since 'flag.txt' already has 8 bytes, we need an extra 8 bytes of '\x00' for the
null-terminated string -> 'flag.txt\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
so we have to do the move twice, first for the first 8 bytes, and a second
for the last 8 bytes
then we put the location of the string into rdi and call print_file
